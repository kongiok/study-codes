# Code Studies

A space dedicated to learning — filled with code samples, notes, and explorations.

## Origin

I’m someone with deep passion for many things.
But I don’t want to learn just for the sake of learning —
my goal is to turn knowledge into something practical and applicable in real life.
That’s why this project was created.

## Structure

For each programming language, the code will be organized into the following directories:

- `basics`
  - Covers the core concepts and syntax of the language.
  - Highlights the key features of the language and when to use it in specific scenarios.

- `data_structures`
  - Implementations and examples of data structures in the language.
  - Learning data structures is one of the most effective ways
    to understand and apply a language.

- `algorithms`
  - Implementations and use cases of algorithms in the language.
  - Once you’ve learned the basics,
    writing more _efficient_ code becomes the next challenge.

- `solutions`
  - Practical problem-solving using the language.
  - Consistently writing code is the best way
    to express your thoughts and sharpen your skills.

> [!WARNING]
> Due to language-specific constraints,
> you may not see these directories directly at the top level.
> Instead, you can find them through the entry points for each language.
